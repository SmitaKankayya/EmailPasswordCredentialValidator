# EmailPasswordCredentialValidator
iOS Framework to validate Email and Password

In this repository, creating a custom framework 'EmailPasswordCredentialValidator'.<br> 
The framework provides functionality to validate email addresses and passwords.<br>
Additionally, will install our custom framework locally using CocoaPods and publish it online.<br> 
Finally, I will use the published version in an existing project.<br>
